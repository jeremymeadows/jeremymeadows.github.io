  <h1>~/about_me</h1>

  <p>
    I enjoy spending time in the outdoors, specifically hiking. I grew up with
    the Rocky Mountains in Colorado, and now I get to explore the Cooley range
    in Louth. I also used to compete in 5k/10ks, and continue to run and work
    out for the social and fitness aspects. In my free time, I enjoy board game
    nights, solving programming puzzles, and playing video games.
