          I wanted to return to education to complete a degree, since that would
          open more doors in future jobs. I also wanted to use my return to
          college as an excuse to travel, and ended up deciding on Ireland
          because of the many employement opportunities which are available
          after graduation if I don't decide to move back to the US.</p> <p>While my Baylor education was almost exclusively software development
          focused, DkIT offers a stream more focused on system administration
          and networking. We have classes on scripting and configuring Linux and
          Windows Server systems, and the labs are equipped with Cisco gear
          which provides great hands-on experience setting up different types of
          networks.</p></div></div></section> <section><div class="collapse"><label class="collapse-title"><input type="checkbox"> <h2>Baylor University</h2> <h3>Computer Science Degree Program<span>August 2017 - December 2020</span></h3></label> <div class="collapse-content"><p>At Baylor, I studied computer science and competed in Cross Country
          and Track for the NCAA team. While I was there, I learned everything
          from traditional software and UI development, to x86 programming and
          decompilation, to graphics programming with linear algebra and OpenGL
          C libraries. Although it isn't necessarily something I indend to
          pursue a job in, one of my favorite classes was our architecture
          class, where I built a fully-programmable computer based on the
          RISC-16 ISA using basic logic gates. I didn't complete the degree
          program at Baylor, but the education I recieved there was definitly
          valuable when I started work in software development and devops the
          following summer.</p> <p>While I definitely learned a lot in the classes, the professors never
          had much availablity for extra help, so I think the most valuable
          skill I acquired was an aptitude for learning stuff quickly. Being
          able to quickly search through documentation to find solutions to a
          problem was a great help when I was working, since I was often given
          tasks which I hadn't had experience with and usually using tools I
          wasn't familiar with. I always felt on top of my tasks and reports
          regardless of my experience on the matter.</p></div></div></section></article>`);function r(e){var a=n();o(e,a)}export{r as component};
